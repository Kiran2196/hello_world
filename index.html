        <strong>Remember:</strong><br><br>
        These tools cannot give you what you already are.<br>
        They only invite pausing, questioning, noticing – not discovery, but recognition of what was never hidden.<br>
        Not finding something new, but seeing what was always obvious.<br>
        The tools are fingers pointing at the sun. Helpful perhaps, but not the sun itself.<br>
        Eventually, drop the fingers.<br>
        The sun doesn't learn to shine. It just is luminous. That's its nature.<br>
        You are awareness.<br>
        It just is.<br>
        That's everything.
